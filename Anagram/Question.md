# Anagram

## Objective

Given two strings and you must check whether the strings are anagrams or not.

(If two words are made of same letters , then the two words are said to be anagrams of each other.)

## Example:
- 1 input: care , race

  output: anagrams
- 2 input: listen, silence

  output: not anagrams

## Constraint:
- Both input and output are strings.

## Points to remember:

- The programming language can be of your choice.
- The answer you make must be saved with file name "{programming_languageused}_{your-github-profilename}.{...}".
- Then keep a merge request with branch name as "{question_name}_solution".
